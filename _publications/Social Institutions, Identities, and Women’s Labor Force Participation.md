excerpt: 'This study explores the effect of social institutions such as religion, caste/denomination/sect within religious groups, and the household on women’s decision to participate in the labor force. The southwestern Indian state of Kerala offers a diverse sociocultural setting to analyze this. Using data from two rounds of the Kerala Migration Survey (KMS) - 2013 and 2018, the study finds that the more educated a woman is, the less likely she is to be gainfully employed. Moreover, the effect of the dominant culture of the region on women’s labor force participation is particularly strong in Malabar where the social norms of the Sunni Muslim sect permeate across religious groups. The study also finds evidence of an economic crisis dismantling long-standing cultural influences that kept Muslim women from participating in the labor force thereby enabling such participation in the latter period of the study.'
