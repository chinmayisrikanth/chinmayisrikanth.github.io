excerpt: 'Extant literature on multigenerational mobility in India establishes the existence of a ‘grandfather effect’. By using distinct models to measure intergenerational and multigenerational educational persistence, this paper contends that this effect can be direct, indirect, or non-existent depending on the identity group - caste or religion - to which the family belongs. The study also finds evidence for differences in persistence due to regional factors. This paper is also the first to develop an identification strategy for multigenerational mobility in India through the use of the abolition of untouchability in 1955 as an instrument for the father’s education. The study is the first to explore The Great Gatsby relation for regions within India using caste and religion-based identifiers. This study finds that the relation holds regardless of the identity group considered.'
