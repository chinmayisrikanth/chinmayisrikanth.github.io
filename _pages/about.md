I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Delhi. Prior to this position, I was a Post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Development Economics (CDE) at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE) and the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG). I was recently awarded the Routledge Inclusive Economics Prize. I hold a PhD in Economics from the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode (IIMK), and my research primarily focuses on development economics. My specific areas of interest include stratification economics, social mobility, intersectionality, and gender. My research focuses on social inequalities and its persistence. I have previously held roles as a Visiting Ph.D. Fellow and consultant at the World Institute for Development Economics Research, United Nations University (UNU-WIDER).
