I'm a Post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Development Economics (CDE), Delhi School of Economics (DSE) and the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG). I'm also a former Visiting Ph.D. Fellow and consultant at UNU-WIDER. I have a doctoral degree in Economics from the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode (IIMK). My broad area of research is development economics. Specifically, my work focuses on stratification economics, social mobility, intersectionality, and gender. I work extensively on the effect of the caste system and patriarchy on economic outcomes in India.
