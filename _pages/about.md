I'm a Visiting Ph.D. Fellow at UNU-WIDER and a doctoral student in Economics at the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode. My broad area of research is development economics. Specifically, my work focuses on identity economics, social mobility, intersectionality, and gender. I work extensively on the effect of the caste system and patriarchy on economic outcomes in India.
