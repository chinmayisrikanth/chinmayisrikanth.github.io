I'm a visiting Ph.D. Fellow at UNU-WIDER and a doctoral student in Economics at the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode. Broadly, my area of research is Development Economics. My work focuses on identity, intersectionality and social mobility. I work extensively on the effect of caste, gender and religion on economic outcomes in the Indian subcontinent.
