I'm a visiting Ph.D. Fellow at UNU-WIDER and a doctoral student in Economics at the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode. My work focuses on identity economics, social mobility, intersectionality, and gender. I work extensively on the effect of the caste system and patriarchy on economic outcomes in India.
